# Can You Make It

This is the code for Can You Make It, a web application allowing people to indicate whether they will join certain events.

The application is mostly a playground that lets me try out all kinds of stuff in the context of an actual application. There will likely be some over-engineering, especially given the size of the development team (only me) and userbase (no one).
